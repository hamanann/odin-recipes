    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I usually have to double this flour tortilla recipe because we go throught them so quickly. The homemade tortillas are so tender and chewy, you'll newver use store-bought again after learning how to make tortillas.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add olive oil and mix it in until flour becomes crumbly.</li>
        <li>Stir in water. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10-12 times, adding a little flour or water if needed to achieve a smooth dough. Let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in 8 portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a 7-in. circle.</li>
        <li>Cook tortillas in a cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, about 1 minute on each side. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
